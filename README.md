## Notes

Vish is made for educational purposes and to simplify the process of creating Bash scripts. It is not intended to replace traditional text-based scripting but rather to provide an alternative way to visualize and construct scripts.  
It can help beginners understand the structure and flow of Bash scripts, making it easier to learn scripting concepts.
